                <section class="about-text">
                    <p>I'm a software engineer passionate about crafting efficient and user-friendly solutions. My
                        <br>journey in tech began at Moringa School, where I honed my coding skills and developed 
                        <br>a strong problem-solving mindset. I enjoy working on projects that challenge me and push
                        <br>me to grow as a developer.
                    </p>

                    <P>Beyond coding, I have a deep love for football and keeping fit. Staying active is important
                        <br>to me, whether it's on the pitch or in the gym. I believe physical fitness not only keeps me
                        <br>healthy but also sharpens my focus and discipline in all aspects of life.
                    </P>

                    <p>Faith is a big part of who I am, and I take pride in serving as a mass server at my church.
                        <br>It gives me a sense of purpose and fulfillment, allowing me to contribute to my community 
                        <br>in a meaningful way. Spending time with family and friends is equally important to me,
                        <br>as they provide support, laughter, and great memories. I am also a loving son, blessed 
                        <br>with caring parents, and a brother to three beautiful sisters whom I deeply cherish.Apart 
                        <br>from that, I am an uncle to a wonderful niece who brings so much joy into my life.
                    </p>

                    <p>I also enjoy unwinding with video games and good music. Whether it's an intense gaming
                        <br>session or just vibing to chill music, these moments help me relax and recharge. I love 
                        <br>attending parties and social gatherings, meeting new people, and creating unforgettable
                        <br>experiences.
                    </p>

                    <p>Life is all about balance, and I believe in making the most of every moment. Whether it's
                        <br>through coding, sports, faith, or fun activities, I strive to enjoy life to the fullest. I'm always
                        <br>open to new opportunities, exciting projects, and collaborations that allow me to grow both
                        <br>professionally and personally.

                <section class="Achievements-text">
                    <p>I am a proud graduate of Juja Preparatory and Senior School, where I attained a C+ overall
                        <br>and an A in English. This achievement not only reflects my dedication to academics but
                        <br>also granted me the opportunity to pursue higher education at the university level. Excelling
                        <br>in English has enhanced my analytical and communication skills, which are crucial in both 
                        <br>software development and leadership.
                    </p>
                
                    <p>Beyond academics, I have taken on leadership roles that shaped my sense of responsibility
                        <br>and teamwork. I served as the Dining Hall Captain, ensuring order and efficiency in school
                        <br>operations, and was honored to lead as the Chairperson of Mass Servers, where I guided 
                        <br>others in serving the church and community. These roles strengthened my leadership 
                        <br>abilities, discipline, and ability to work well with others.
                    </p>
            
                    <p>I am also a certified St. John Ambulance First Aid Giver and Sergeant, trained to handle 
                        <br>emergencies with skill and composure. This certification has allowed me to assist in critical 
                        <br>situations, emphasizing my dedication to helping others and ensuring safety. This experience 
                        <br>has also reinforced my ability to stay calm under pressure, an essential skill in both 
                        <br>emergency response and problem-solving in the tech industry.
                    </p>

                    <p>Athletics has played a major role in shaping my discipline and resilience. I have won several 
                        <br>medals in athletic competitions, showcasing my commitment to continuous improvement 
                        <br>and excellence. Additionally, my passion for football has earned me multiple awards, 
                        <br>reflecting my teamwork, strategy, and sportsmanship. Engaging in sports has taught me 
                        <br>valuable lessons in perseverance, adaptability, and working towards a common goal.
                    </p>

                    <p>Balancing academics, leadership, service, and sports has helped me become a well-rounded 
                        <br>individual. I take pride in my ability to manage responsibilities while making time for 
                        <br>family, friends, and personal growth. These achievements fuel my ambition, and I am always 
                        <br>eager to take on new challenges, expand my skills, and create meaningful connections in 
                        <br>both my professional and personal life.

                <section class="Education-text">
                    <p>My educational journey began at St. Teresia Nursery School, where I took my first steps into 
                        <br>structured learning. It was here that I developed the foundational skills that would shape my 
                        <br>curiosity and love for knowledge. As I progressed to Laureate School, I built a strong academic 
                        <br>base, learning the importance of discipline, determination, and a passion for continuous growth. 
                        <br>These early years instilled in me the confidence and adaptability needed to take on greater 
                        <br>challenges in my academic path.
                    </p>

                    <p>At Juja Preparatory and Senior School, I embraced both academic and personal growth, striving 
                        <br>to excel in my studies while developing leadership qualities. My C+ overall and an A in English 
                        <br>were a testament to my hard work and commitment to learning. Achieving this milestone granted 
                        <br>me the eligibility to pursue higher education, opening doors to greater opportunities in my
                        <br>academic and professional future.
                    </p>

                    <p>Currently, I am honing my technical skills at Moringa School, where I am specializing in software 
                        <br>engineering. This intensive and hands-on program has equipped me with practical coding skills, 
                        <br>problem-solving techniques, and a deep understanding of web development. The fast-paced and 
                        <br>industry-driven curriculum has strengthened my ability to think critically and innovate in the 
                        <br>field of technology.
                    </p>

                    <p>As I continue to advance in my studies, my next goal is to join USIU University to pursue a 
                        <br>degree in computer science. I am eager to expand my expertise in software development, 
                        <br>artificial intelligence, and emerging technologies. My vision is to not only master the technical 
                        <br>aspects of computing but also to develop solutions that have a real-world impact.
                   </p>

                    <p>Education has been the cornerstone of my ambitions, shaping both my intellect and character. 
                        <br>Each institution I have attended has played a crucial role in my growth, preparing me for the 
                        <br>dynamic world of technology. As I look toward the future, I am committed to continuous 
                        <br>learning, innovation, and making meaningful contributions to the ever-evolving tech industry.
